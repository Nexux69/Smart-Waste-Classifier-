## Overview

Smart Waste Classifier is a machine learning project designed to automate the classification of waste materials into appropriate categories (e.g., recyclable, organic, landfill) using image recognition techniques. Built to run seamlessly on Google Colab, this project aims to contribute to efficient waste management and environmental sustainability.

## Features

- **Automated Waste Classification:** Uses computer vision to identify and sort waste items.
- **Google Colab Notebooks:** All code and experiments are provided as interactive Colab notebooks—no local setup required.
- **Custom Dataset:** Trained on a dataset of common waste images (customize as needed).
- **Model Evaluation & Visualization:** Includes metrics, confusion matrices, and visual outputs.
- **Easy to Extend:** Designed for further research and improvements.
