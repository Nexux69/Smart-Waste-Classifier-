Waste Classification
This project uses MobileNetV2 to classify waste images into two categories:

Biodegradable

Non-Biodegradable

It aims to promote smart waste segregation by leveraging deep learning and computer vision.


Features

Image Classification: Detects if the waste is biodegradable or non-biodegradable.

Lightweight Model: Uses MobileNetV2 for fast and efficient inference.

Google Colab Training: Model trained in Colab for GPU acceleration.

Real-time Prediction Ready: Can be integrated with cameras or mobile devices.



Dataset

The dataset consists of labeled waste images split into:

Training set

Validation set

Test set

ðŸ“Œ Labels:

Biodegradable

Non-Biodegradable
