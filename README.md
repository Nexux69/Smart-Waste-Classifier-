## Overview

Smart Waste Classifier is a machine learning project designed to automate the classification of waste materials into appropriate categories (e.g., recyclable, organic, landfill) using image recognition techniques. Built primarily with Jupyter Notebook, this project aims to contribute to efficient waste management and environmental sustainability.

## Features

- **Automated Waste Classification:** Uses computer vision to identify and sort waste items.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** All code and experiments are presented as easy-to-follow notebooks.
- **Custom Dataset:** Trained on a dataset of common waste images (customize as needed).
- **Model Evaluation & Visualization:** Includes metrics, confusion matrices, and visual outputs.
- **Easy to Extend:** Designed for further research and improvements.

## Demo

*Add screenshots or GIFs showing the notebook and classification results here if available.*

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook
- Common ML/Data Science libraries (see below)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Nexux69/Smart-Waste-Classifier-.git
   cd Smart-Waste-Classifier-
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   You can use `pip` or `conda` to install the required libraries. The primary dependencies include:
   - numpy
   - pandas
   - matplotlib
   - scikit-learn
   - tensorflow / keras
   - opencv-python

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(If a `requirements.txt` is not present, install manually as above.)*

3. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
   Open the main notebook file (e.g., `SmartWasteClassifier.ipynb`).

## Usage

1. **Prepare the Dataset:**  
   Ensure your images are organized as described in the notebook or project docs.
2. **Run the Notebook:**  
   Execute each cell sequentially to train, validate, and test the model.
3. **Customize & Experiment:**  
   Try different models, datasets, or preprocessing techniques as desired.
